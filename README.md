# Deep Learning based Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition
This project was undertaken as part of Deep Learning for `Adavanced Robot Perception` course offered in Worcester Polytechnic Institute, during Fall 2016. A paper was written on the project and has been submitted at CAIP 2017 (http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/CAIP2017.html).

The objective of this project is to perform real-time facial expression recognition using deep CNN models. The CNN model is first trained using Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenege dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge). The inference model, uses the trained weights, to make predictions on the input video feed. The faces in the video are loclaized using Haar classifier.
